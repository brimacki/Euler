We are to find the largest palindrome that is the result of the multiplicaiton from two 3-digit numbers.

The numbers range between 10,000 and 998001.

Things to watch out for: Difference between 5 and 6 digit numbers (though not an issue since the first palindrome will happen with 6 digits.

Attempt 1:
	-Create all possible numbers in descending order
	-Run an algorithm on a vector in descending order until a palindrom is found
	-Output from bash time:
		real	0m0.073s
		user	0m0.068s
		sys	0m0.003s
	-Future optimizations:
		--This algorithm seems very efficient.
		--This algorithm could benefit from performance tuning.
