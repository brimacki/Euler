We are to find the largest prime factor of a *very* large prime number (approx. 6E11).

Things to watch out for:
	-Large number
	-Ensuring correctness

Attempt 1:
	-Three main loops:
		--All factors of the large number
		--Pick out only the prime factors of the large number
		--Report the largest prime factor (easy!)
	-This will use the vector container of C++ since it has many nice built-in functions.
	-Output from bash time:
		real	0m0.007s
		user	0m0.005s
		sys	0m0.001s
	-Future optimizations:
		--This can probably be solved by recursion
		--This algorithm probably does not need to find all the factors first. It can probably check factors along the way.
