We are to find the summation of the of the even-valued terms of the Fibonacci sequence up to 4 million.

Things to watch out for:
	-There is nothing really to watch out for here.

Attempt 1:
	-This implementation will not be performance optimal.
	-This implementation will be done in two parts, and probably consume a high level of memory:
		--Generate the Fibonacci sequence in a C++ vector.
		--Sum up all numbers divisible by 2.
	-Output from bash time:
		real	0m0.008s
		user	0m0.002s
		sys	0m0.003s
	-Future optimizations:
		--Declaring some parameters as constants
		--Find a way to create the sequence and sum the values in the same loop
		--Find a way to make this as a for loop instead of a conditional
