We need to find the difference between the square of the sums and the sum of the squares.

Things to watch out for: Nothing. This actually has an easy mathematical trick because the formulas can be reduced to a function of the maximum number in the range.

Attempt 1:
	-Write out the formula in code.
	-Output from bash time:
		real	0m0.007s
		user	0m0.002s
		sys	0m0.003s
	-Further optimizations:
		--None
