We are to find the sum of all numbers less than 1000 that are multiples of 3 or 5.

Things to watch out for:
	-Are we meant to include 1000? If written precisely, no.
	-Don't double count multiples of 15.

Attempt 1:
	-This implementation will not be performance optimal.
	-Loop over all numbers 1-999 and add to a running sum if multiples of 3 or 5.
	-Do the same and subtract any numbers that are multiples of 15.
	-This prodcued the correct solution.
	-Output from bash time:
		real	0m0.008s
		user	0m0.003s
		sys	0m0.004s
	-Possible optimizations:
		--Declaration of N as a const int
		--Input N from the command line
		--Do check for multiples of 3 || 5 U 15 in a more efficient way
		--Parallelization
		--Compiler/architecutre optimizations
